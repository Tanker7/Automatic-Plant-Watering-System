Automatic Plant Watering System
This project is an Arduino-based automatic plant watering system designed to monitor soil moisture levels and control a water pump accordingly. The system utilizes an Arduino Uno microcontroller to read data from a soil moisture sensor and activate a pump when the soil is too dry. Real-time data, including soil moisture levels and pump status, is displayed on an OLED screen for easy monitoring.

Features
- Automatic Pump Control: The water pump is activated or deactivated based on soil moisture levels, ensuring efficient watering without human intervention.
- Real-Time Display: An OLED screen shows current soil moisture levels, pump status, and moisture percentage, allowing users to monitor the system in real-time.
- Threshold-Based Operation: Soil moisture thresholds are set to determine dry, moderate, and wet conditions, ensuring accurate watering cycles.
- Firmata Integration: The project uses the Firmata library for interfacing with the I2C device and managing system inputs and outputs.
